Roadmap:
--------
- Pull data from ExaAI for news events and articles about relevant information about the topic I choose
- Somehow have a base Style_Guide instead of what gets found everytime based on the newsletters.
	- Interesting.. think about maybe redoing the styleguide every 10 newsletters? Re configuring the AI writer almost.
- This style guide almost reminds me of a context window or like some sort of backstory.
- There are some roles that I can adjust in the research agent and the writer agent
- New agents
- Can we pull in the images from the previous newsletters? Is there anything relevant we can get from that?
	- What can we do for images. (Maybe an add your images in "post processing?" Where the AI thinks a good image could be added for context or reference to better understand the point.
- Put in a subject and a subheading for the topic as well as a brief one paragraph for the AI to then take it from there. 
- Example companies to use and reference (more context)
- 




- Use Postbridge to post to different socials??????


- Read every line of code and understand each concept
- Agents, Tasks, Main, Scraper
