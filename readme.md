# WriteAI

WriteAI is a multi-agent crew that scrapes previously written beehiiv articles and then analyzes the tonage and writes a new article based off a given topic.

- This is an exploration into AI-Agents and agentic frameworks like CrewAI. Leveraging the power of open source LLMs and open source frameworks like CrewAI, the goal with this project is to see if I can scrape my previous newsletters I have published and create a sort of voice or tone for my writing style and have AI write my newsletters for me. 

- We have busy lives -- if an orchestra of reserach agents, writer agents, news agents, etc can replicate my process and research objectives when I do research on stocks and market analysis I think that would be fascinating to see play out.

- Roadmap is being planned out slowly, want to fully understand the codebase at hand first. Some is AI generated some is grabbed from documentation on [CrewAI Docs](https://crewai.com).

- Long term goal here is to spin this exploration off into a SaaS product that can be used by beehiiv creators like myself! 
    - (perhaps newsletter platform agnostic if i can understand how to scrape effectively.)
